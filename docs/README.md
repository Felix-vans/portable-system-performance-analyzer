This folder documents the reasoning behind the project.

It’s used to explain design decisions, architectural choices, and security considerations, with the goal of making clear why things were built the way they were and how safety and reliability were taken into account. Some documents focus on the design of specific programs or components, others explain how those parts fit into the larger system.

If you want to understand how the project evolved over time, start with **History**. It gives the clearest view of the project’s development and how my thinking changed as new problems and constraints came up.
