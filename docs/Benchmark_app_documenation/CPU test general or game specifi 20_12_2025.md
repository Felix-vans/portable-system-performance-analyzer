# Does the CPU test need to be game specific or is a general CPU test good enough
I want to make this program specific to gaming so I want to test and improve the CPU in regards to gaming. My idea was to make a CPU test that preforms calculations specific for gaming. However, I think a general CPU test will also clearly show the performance of the CPU.

## What I'm going to do
So I want to test this, I am going to make 2 different programs one that measures overall CPU performance and CPU performance for gaming. The general CPU performance program will do a lot of operations like multiplying, dividing, raising numbers to a certain power, etc. The other program will perform more game specifc operations like position updates of points (x, y z), vector manipulation, maybe also some AI decision simulations and mathimatical operations.
To properly test the differene I will perform both tests multiple times on 3 different devices. I will be looking for big differences in the genral CPU test and gaming specific CPU test. I am looking for a linear relation between the results meaning if the general test is 3 times better on one device compared to another that the gaming specific CPU test is also 3 times better. I will be dividing the average results of both test on the same device to get a constant. If this constant is similar on all 3 devives I can conclude that a general CPU test works just as well a gaming specific test.

## Expectations
I think the constant will be constant meaning the CPU test and gaming specific CPU test will measure the same thing. If this is the case I will be using a general CPU test to avoid over compicating things.
