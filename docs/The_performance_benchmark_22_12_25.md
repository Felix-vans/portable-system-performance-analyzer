# The Performance Benchmarkt module of this project

**The first module I will me making in this project is a performance benchmarkt. This benchmark will be performed before and after the bottleneck detection and solution modules. Thus we can get a clear picture of how much the program actually improves game specific performance.**

## What will this module be made of?
The module will consist of three programs that measure the overall system performance.

First, this program will include a game specific CPU test. I already have a simple gaming-specific CPU benchmark used in my [CPU performance experiment](/experiment/cpu_performance_experiment/cpu_test_experiment.md). I will be improving upon this programm by adding more suphisticated test that are even more catered towards gaming-specific performance. This will include: [to be filled in].

Second, I will add a program that measures the RAM performance. It will be measuring for errors, speed and latency. 

The third and last program I will add is going to measure the overall storage health and stability. These tests will measure for troughput (MB/s), Input/Output Operations per Second and latency.

## How will these benchmarks be used in the whole system
