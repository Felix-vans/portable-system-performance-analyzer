# Portable System Performance Analyzer 🚀

A portable tool that analyzes a computer’s gaming performance, identifies bottlenecks, and provides clear, actionable advice to improve system responsiveness — all designed to run from a USB stick.

## 📌 What is this project?
The **Portable System Performance Analyzer** is a performance analysis tool focused on gaming workloads. It benchmarks key system components such as the **CPU, RAM, and storage**, evaluates how well a machine can handle modern games, and highlights potential bottlenecks that may be limiting performance.

Once these bottlenecks are identified, the program explains **why** they matter and gives **practical instructions** on how users can improve their system themselves. The long-term goal is to make this tool fully portable, so it can be plugged into any computer and run without installation.

## 🎯 Why am I making this?
This project is primarily a **learning exercise**. I’m building it to:
- Deepen my understanding of how computers and operating systems work  
- Improve my programming and system-level reasoning skills  
- Create a real, non-trivial project for my portfolio  

At the same time, the tool is meant to be genuinely useful. Many people have slow machines but don’t know *why*. This project aims to bridge that gap by turning raw performance data into **clear, understandable guidance**. It will also serve as a strong portfolio piece for my future job search.

## ⚠️ What it can’t do (yet)
- It does **not automatically fix bottlenecks**. For security and safety reasons, the program only provides guidance.
- It cannot resolve **hardware limitations** (e.g. a slow CPU or insufficient RAM). The focus is on **OS-level and application-level optimizations**.
- Bottleneck detection and impact analysis are still under development.

This project is still in an early stage. A lot of functionality is missing, but the goal is to have a **first working prototype before February 2026**.

## 🧠 How it works (concept)
The planned workflow is split into three logical phases:

1. **Benchmarking**  
   The system’s CPU, RAM, and storage performance are measured to generate an overall “health score”.

2. **Bottleneck detection**  
   The program scans for potential OS and application-level issues that may be negatively impacting performance.

3. **Impact analysis & guidance**  
   Detected bottlenecks are ranked from most to least impactful, and the user receives step-by-step advice on how to address them.

This architecture represents the current vision and will likely evolve as development continues.

## 🛠️ Current status
- ✅ First version of the benchmark application completed  
- ✅ CPU, RAM, and storage benchmarks implemented  
- 🔧 Final tuning and cleanup in progress  

The benchmark results are already being used to calculate an overall system health score, which will form the foundation for future bottleneck analysis.

---

## 📈 Roadmap
- Improve benchmark accuracy and consistency  
- Implement bottleneck detection logic  
- Add clear, user-friendly explanations and recommendations  
- Package the tool for portable (USB) usage

This project is actively evolving. Expect changes, refactors, and new ideas as the system grows and becomes more refined.
