# portable-system-performance-analyzer

## What is this this project?
In this project I will be making a program that analyses the performance of a computer in regards to playing video games. After analysing the performance of the machine, it will look for bottlenecks that might be causing the worse performance. The programm will then give the user clear instructions on how to fix these bottlenecks. My goal is to put this program on a usb stick so I can plug it into any computer to make it faster.

## Why am I making this project=
This is mainly a learning exercise for me. I want to develop my coding skills and better understand how computers work in general. I am also making this for myself and all the people who have a slow machine so they can get clear instructions on how to fix it themselves. This project will also be added to my portfolio to help me stand out in my future job search.

## What it can't do (yet)
It can't yet detect the bottlenecks nor will it actually be able to fix it on itself because of risks with security. It will also not be able to improve hardware problems it can only fix apllication and OS related bottlenecks to boost the performance of the computer. 
Because I am still in the early stages of development tbere is still a lot this program can't do yet but my goal is to have a first working prototype before february 2026.

## How it works in general
My idea is to first make an appliication that analyses the general performance of the machine by testing CPU performance, RAM and storage. Next, another application will look for potential bottlenecks in the OS or applications. The final application will analyse the imnpact of each of these bottlenecks and then in chronological order from most to least impactful, advice the user on how to fix these issues.
This is my starting idea on how this program will work and this will most definitely change in the future as I start development.

## Current status
A first version for a CPU benchmark has been made. Currently working on the component that analyses the RAM.
