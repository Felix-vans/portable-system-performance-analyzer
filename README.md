# portable-system-performance-analyzer

## What is this this project?
In this project I will be making a program that analyses the speed of a computer in regards with playing video games. After analysing the speed of the machine, it will look for bottlenecks that might be causing the slower speed. The programm will then give the user clear instructions on how to fix these bottlenecks. My goal is to put this program on a usb stick so I can plug it into any computer and make it faster.

## Why am I making this project
For me, this is mainly a learning exercise. I want to develop my coding skills and better understand how computers work in general. I am also making this for myself and all the people whom have a slow machine so they can get clear instructions on how to fix it themselves. This project will also be added to my portfolio to help me stand out in my future job search.

## What it can't do (yet)
I haven't really started yet so it can basically do nothing.

## How it works in general
My idea is to first make a module that analyses the speed of the GPU. Next, another module will look for potential bottle necks mainly in the OS or applications, not the hardwawre because this isn't always easy or possible for the user to fix and I want to keep it accesible for people with less computer knowledge. The final module will analyse the imnpact of each of these bottlenecks and then in chronological order from most to least impactful it will advice the user on how to fix these issues.
This is my starting idea on how this program will work and this will most definitely change in the future as I start development.

## Current status
I just started devolpment.
